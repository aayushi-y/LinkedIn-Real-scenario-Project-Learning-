Business problem:
A manager on the marketing team comes to you to ask about the performance of their recent email campaign. Now that the campaign has been launched, the marketing manager wants 
to know how many users have clicked the link in the email.
While this project was being planned, you collaborated with the front-end engineers to create tracking events for the front end of the product located in the frontendeventlog 
table. One of these events, eventid = 5, is logged when the user reaches a unique landing page that is only accessed from this campaign email. Since the event tracks when a 
user views the unique landing page from the email, tracking eventid= 5 will be the best method to count how many users have clicked the link.

Since an overall aggregate metric like an average can hide outliers and further insights under the hood, you decide it's best to calculate the distribution of the number 
of email link clicks per user. In other words, how many users clicked the email link one time, two times, three times, and so on?
Since the frontendeventlog only logs events that do happen, we can't count the number of users that received the email but didn't click on the link unless we bring in the 
data from somewhere else. For simplicity, let's ignore this group and only count the events, or email clicks, in the frontendeventlog.

Task:
Using a CTE and the frontendeventlog table, find the distribution of users across the number of times the email link was clicked per user.
In other words, count the number of users, num_users, in each num_link_clicks category (one click, two clicks, three clicks,...) using eventid = 5 to track link clicks.

                    GROUP BY USERID

Select COUNT(NUM_LINK_CLICKS) AS num_users, NUM_LINK_CLICKS
